## Introduction

This README provides a detailed guide for the MAD-PWA-Exp-3 GitHub repository. This repository contains various Dart files used for mobile application development experiments, particularly focusing on Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) with Flutter.

## Repository Structure

The repository consists of several Dart files, each serving a different purpose in demonstrating Flutter widgets and functionalities:

- **Alignment.dart**: Demonstrates the usage of the Alignment widget for positioning elements.
- **AspectRatio.dart**: Shows how to maintain the aspect ratio of a widget.
- **Baseline.dart**: Explores the Baseline widget for aligning widgets according to a baseline.
